This project was completed on behalf of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) as an extension of an ongoing USAF mission to monitor the health of bases associated with Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO). Given that social media data can be used to characterize a group or region, the goal of this project was to use twitter data to reveal the opinions and attitudes about USAF issues of interest. This included minor concerns such as housing options to more serious matters such as force morale, mental health, and nuclear security. My primary methods to achieve this were sentiment analysis and topic modeling using existing large language models. Hereafter, I provide an analysis of my findings related to this mission as well as the efficacy of various natural language processing techniques for this task.
